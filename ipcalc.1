.SH NAME
ipcalc \- perform simple manipulation of IP addresses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipcalc
[\fIOPTION\fR]... <\fBIP address\fR>[\fI/prefix\fR] [\fInetmask\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBipcalc\fR provides a simple way to calculate IP information for a host
or network. The various options specify what information \fBipcalc\fR should display
on standard out. Multiple options may be specified.  An IP address to
operate on must always be specified.  Most operations also require a
netmask or a CIDR prefix as well.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
Validate the IP address under the specified family. 

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-random-private\fR
Generate a random private address using the supplied prefix.

.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4\fR
Explicitly specify the IPv4 address family.

.TP
\fB\-6\fR, \fB\-\-ipv6\fR
Explicitly specify the IPv6 address family.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-broadcast\fR
Display the broadcast address for the given IP address and netmask.
The variable exposed is BROADCAST (if available).

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-hostname\fR
Display the hostname for the given IP address.
The variable exposed is HOSTNAME.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-lookup-host\fR
Display the IP address for the given hostname.
The variable exposed is ADDRESS.

.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-geoinfo\fR
Display geographic information for the given IP address. This option
requires libGeoIP to be available. The variables exposed are
COUNTRYCODE, COUNTRY, CITY and COORDINATES (when available).

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-netmask\fR
Calculate the netmask for the given IP address. If no mask or prefix
is provided, in IPv6 a 128-bit mask is assumed, while in IPv4 it assumes
that the IP address is in a complete class A, B, or C network. Note, 
however, that many networks no longer use the default netmasks in IPv4.
The variable exposed is NETMASK.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR
Show the prefix for the given mask/IP address.
The variable exposed is PREFIX.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-network\fR 
Display the network address for the given IP address and netmask.
The variable exposed is NETWORK.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-minaddr\fR 
Display the minimum host address in the provided network.
The variable exposed is MINADDR.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-maxaddr\fR 
Display the maximum host address in the provided network.
The variable exposed is MAXADDR.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-addresses\fR 
Display the number of host addresses in the provided network.
The variable exposed is ADDRESSES.

.TP
\fB\   \fR \fB\-\-addrspace\fR 
Display address space allocation information for the provided network.
The variable exposed is ADDRSPACE.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR 
Display generic information on the provided network (default).

.TP
\fB\-\-all\-info\fR 
Display verbose information on the provided network and addresses. That
includes GeoIP information.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR 
Don't ever display error messages.
